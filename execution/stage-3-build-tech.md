🔧 STAGE 3 — EXECUTION, TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY & COMPETITIVE RESPONSE PROMPT
(Engineering tickets → GTM assets → user validation → competitor response → platform & tech stack analysis)
You can paste this directly into ChatGPT or Gemini after Stage 2 is complete.

ROLE
You are now acting as a founder + technical product lead + competitive strategist.
You have access to:
Stage 1 research output


Stage 2 selected wedge, PRD, MVP definition, pricing, and GTM strategy


Your goal is to:
Translate strategy into buildable artifacts


Validate assumptions with users


Identify technical and platform-level leverage


Anticipate Squire’s response and design counters



INPUT ASSUMPTIONS
Assume:
The primary wedge and MVP are locked unless kill criteria are triggered


Speed-to-market and differentiation matter more than feature parity



STEP 1: MVP → ENGINEERING TICKETS (REQUIRED)
Convert the approved MVP into engineering-ready tickets.
For each ticket, include:
Ticket title


Description


User story


Acceptance criteria


Priority (P0 / P1 / P2)


Dependencies


Risk level (Low / Medium / High)


Group tickets by:
Frontend


Backend


Mobile


Integrations (payments, calendars, messaging, etc.)


Also identify:
What can be hardcoded or faked in v1


What must be real for validation



STEP 2: PLATFORM & TECH STACK ANALYSIS (NEW — MANDATORY)
For each major competitor identified in Stage 1, analyze:
A. Platform Availability
Web (desktop)


iOS


Android


Tablet / kiosk


Offline mode support


B. Observed or Inferred Tech Stack
Based on:
Public job postings


Developer blogs


App behavior/performance


Known frameworks


Attempt to identify:
Frontend frameworks (React, Flutter, native, etc.)


Backend stack (Node, Rails, etc.)


Mobile approach (native vs cross-platform)


Infrastructure assumptions (monolith vs modular)


C. Platform & Stack Constraints
Identify likely limitations caused by:
Cross-platform compromises


Legacy architecture


Mobile-first vs desktop-first tradeoffs


Performance or offline issues


Slow iteration cycles


D. Strategic Opportunities
For each limitation:
How it impacts user experience


How it may cause pain or friction


What a modern or alternative stack could enable instead


E. Recommendations
Propose:
A recommended tech stack for your product


Why it better supports the chosen wedge


Tradeoffs (cost, hiring, complexity)


⚠️ Do NOT recommend technology for novelty — only if it unlocks user or business advantage.

STEP 3: USER VALIDATION — INTERVIEW SCRIPTS
Design user interview scripts to validate the wedge.
Create:
1 script for shop owners


1 script for individual barbers


Each script must include:
Warm-up questions


Pain-discovery questions


Workflow walkthrough questions


Switch-trigger questions


Pricing sensitivity questions


Kill-signal questions (to invalidate the idea)


Explicitly note:
What answers validate the wedge


What answers should trigger reconsideration



STEP 4: GTM → LANDING PAGE COPY
Turn the GTM strategy into landing page copy.
Include:
Headline (pain-first)


Subheadline (promise)


3–5 benefit bullets (not features)


Social proof placeholders


Objection-handling section


Call to action


Messaging must:
Contrast Squire implicitly (not by name)


Emphasize the wedge


Speak in the user’s language, not SaaS jargon



STEP 5: SIMULATE SQUIRE’S RESPONSE (COMPETITIVE WAR-GAME)
Simulate how Squire might respond if this product gains traction.
Analyze:
What they would copy


What they would ignore


What they are structurally slow or unwilling to change


Where their incentives conflict with your wedge


Then propose:
Defensive moves


Product counters


GTM counters


Strategic moats (technical, behavioral, or brand)



STEP 6: FINAL EXECUTION READINESS CHECK
Answer explicitly:
What assumptions remain unproven?


What could kill this in 90 days?


What is the fastest path to real user signal?


What should not be built yet?



FINAL OUTPUT STRUCTURE
Engineering Ticket Breakdown


Platform & Tech Stack Competitive Analysis


Recommended Stack & Rationale


User Interview Scripts


Landing Page Copy


Squire Response Simulation


Counter-Strategy


Execution Risks & Kill Signals



FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
Be pragmatic


Favor leverage over perfection


Call out weak assumptions


Kill complexity early



✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA
This output should make it obvious:
What engineers build next week


What users you talk to next


What Squire would do if you succeed


Where you have a real edge
