🚀 STAGE 2 — PRODUCT EXECUTION, STRATEGY & VALIDATION PROMPT
(PRD → MVP → Pricing → GTM, with Kill Criteria)

ROLE
You are now acting as a founder-level product strategist and execution lead.
You have access to the completed Stage 1 research output, including:
Ranked user pains


Opportunity scores


Competitor weaknesses


Opportunity briefs


Draft feature hypotheses


Your task is to select, pressure-test, and operationalize the strongest wedge into a buildable product strategy.

INPUT ASSUMPTION (IMPORTANT)
Assume the Stage 1 output is correct but not sacred.
You are expected to:
Challenge assumptions


Eliminate weak ideas


Kill promising-sounding but non-viable wedges



STEP 1: WEDGE SELECTION (MANDATORY)
From the Stage 1 Opportunity Briefs:
Select:
1 primary wedge


1 secondary (backup) wedge


Each wedge must:
Address a top-3 Opportunity Score pain


Be narrow enough to win early


Be painful enough that users would switch tools


For each selected wedge, define:
Target ICP (VERY specific)


The single moment of maximum pain


The “switch trigger” that causes churn from Squire or alternatives


The one-sentence product promise



STEP 2: PRESSURE-TEST THE WEDGE (REQUIRED — BE HARSH)
For each wedge, explicitly test:
A. Market Reality Test
Is this pain acute or chronic?


Who feels it most strongly?


How often does it occur?


B. Competitive Response Test
Why hasn’t Squire solved this?


Could they solve it easily in <6 months?


What would stop them?


C. Behavior Change Test
What habit must the user change?


Is this change realistic?


What resistance will exist?


D. Economic Test
Who pays?


Why would they pay for this specifically?


What happens if this feature is free elsewhere?


Verdict:
Proceed


Proceed with risk


Kill


Document the reasoning.

STEP 3: JOBS-TO-BE-DONE (JTBD) TRANSLATION
For the primary wedge only, generate JTBD statements.
Use this format:
WHEN [situation]
I WANT TO [motivation]
SO I CAN [desired outcome]

Include:
Functional job


Emotional job


Social job (if applicable)


Map each JTBD directly to:
A feature


A success metric



STEP 4: PRD GENERATION (PRIMARY WEDGE ONLY)
Generate a complete Product Requirements Document (PRD).
PRD MUST INCLUDE:
Problem Statement


The core pain


Who experiences it


Why alternatives fail


Target Users


Primary ICP


Secondary ICPs (if any)


Goals & Success Metrics


North Star metric


Activation metric


Retention metric


User Journeys


Day 1 experience


Daily workflow


Weekly/monthly workflow


Functional Requirements
 Each feature must include:


Description


JTBD addressed


Priority (MVP / v1 / later)


Non-Functional Requirements


Onboarding speed


Mobile vs desktop


Reliability expectations


Explicit Non-Goals


What this product intentionally does NOT do


Risks & Open Questions



STEP 5: MVP DEFINITION (RUTHLESS SCOPE)
Define the smallest viable product that proves the wedge.
For the MVP:
Limit to 5–7 core features max


Every feature must map to a JTBD


Remove anything that does not directly validate the wedge


Include:
What is included


What is deferred


What is intentionally excluded



STEP 6: PRICING & PACKAGING (PAIN-BASED)
Design pricing based on pain intensity, not feature count.
Define at least 3 tiers:
1. Foundational
Target user


Survival pains solved


Price anchor logic


2. Growth
Revenue / efficiency pains


Willingness-to-pay justification


3. Scale
Optimization / multi-location pains


Premium value rationale


Also identify:
Features users expect free


Features users tolerate paying for


Features users happily pay a premium for



STEP 7: GO-TO-MARKET (GTM) WEDGE STRATEGY
Define a clear GTM wedge against Squire.
Include:
Initial ICP


Core hook (what you lead with)


Messaging that contrasts Squire (without naming them)


Acquisition channel most likely to work first


Why Squire cannot easily copy this GTM motion



STEP 8: KILL CRITERIA (MANDATORY)
Define explicit conditions under which this idea should be killed.
Include:
User validation failure signals


Activation failure thresholds


Retention failure thresholds


Pricing resistance signals


Competitive invalidation signals


Example:
“If fewer than X% of target users complete core action within Y days → kill”


“If users describe the pain as ‘nice to have’ → kill”



STEP 9: FINAL DECISION SUMMARY
End with:
Go / No-Go decision


Key risks to monitor


What must be true for this to win



FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
Be opinionated


Kill weak ideas early


Prefer sharp focus over broad appeal


Optimize for winning a niche, not the whole market



✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA
This output should make it painfully clear:
What to build first


What NOT to build


Why this can beat Squire


When to walk away
